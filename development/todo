Main APP

- add main menu to header for quick navigation.
- add users, this way each user will only see their own lists.
- line_items should have a quantity

BUGS
- When creating a new line item the proper list needs to be selected automatically. currently it defaults to the first list.

TDD
- now that the app has basic functionality,start using rspec for testing

Style
- add css and start styling the pages
- possibly add foundation 5
